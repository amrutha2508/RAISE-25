Using the category probabilties from the classifier(stored in predictions.json) we will create appropriate prediction sets based on categories whose prediction probabilities exceed a given threshold value(one for broad categories one for society categories). This process allows us to dynamically categorize headlines and accurately assign them to one or more categories based on their prediction scores.\n","2.
